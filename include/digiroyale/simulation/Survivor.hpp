//things to note: 
// - survivors with higher dexterity will have lower strength and vice versa
// - trust stat also affects how closely survivor travels with allies,
//   lower trust means farther away which means group is more noticeable and thus
//   lowers survivability of group, but higher trust can make you dismiss an ally 
//   hurting you and thus lowers your individual survivability
// - Sneaky and Curiousity are inverses of each other
// - Care and crafty are inverses of each other
// - Higher charisma means you'll find it easier to convince others to be your ally, but
//	 it will lower your max energy as it takes more energy to keep their trust in you
